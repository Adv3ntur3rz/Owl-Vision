# Owl Vision

  This is a virtual mask created for Creative Programming II class. It uses [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and the [FaceMesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh) model to track your face and superimpose an owl mask on your face. The mask also creates circles of "vision" that extend from your eyes and creates pockets of color in an otherwise greyscale video feed.

## Inspiration

  It is no secret that I am a fan of owls, so for this personal mask I wanted to create something owl-related. One aspect of owls that I admire and relate to is their perceptiveness. They have amazing vision and hearing, and I like to think I share that perception, so I based the idea of the mask on the owl's vision. I designed the mask to be geometric because it reflects my logical and technical approach in creating things, and the colors and tall horns of the mask reflect traditional Dominican carnival masks.
